You're a regular boring house cat. Except your not boring... and not regular either. And cats are not boring in general, but that's beside the point. There's a burning desire within you to become a live stream star and in our game you explore various genres of video content creation in a series of mini challenges.

The game can be played one handed with only a mouse.
